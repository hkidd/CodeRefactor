Homework - UT Coding Boot Camp (Week 1)

## Tasks: 
The client, a search engine optimization company, wants a codebase that follows accessibility standards so that their own website will be more recognized by search engines (ironic).

## Steps taken:
First, many of the basic html elements were replaced with semantic html elements.  Comments were also added to help distinguish the different sections of the website.

Next, the various classes used across the html elements were consolidated to reduce the need for multiple CSS selectors.  The reduction in CSS selectors along with CSS property consolidation vastly reduced the amount of code needed to display the same website before and after.
